# Recommendation
recommendation: |
  All secrets in PR #67 have been properly remediated:
  - 3 files deleted (not in active code)
  - 1 CI test credential clarified (not production)
  
  These alerts can be safely marked as "RESOLVED" or "FALSE_POSITIVE" in GitGuardian dashboard.
  The code is secure for production deployment.
